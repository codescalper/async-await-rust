# async-await-rust

This Rust project showcases asynchronous programming with the `reqwest`, `error-chain`, and `tokio` crates. It demonstrates making asynchronous HTTP requests and handling errors in Rust.

## Dependencies

- [`reqwest`](https://docs.rs/reqwest/0.11.2/reqwest/) is a powerful HTTP client for making requests to web services. It supports various features like async/await, JSON, and more.

- [`error-chain`](https://docs.rs/error-chain/0.12.4/error_chain/) simplifies the process of creating structured and reusable error types in Rust, making error handling more robust.

- [`tokio`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/) is an asynchronous runtime that enables writing non-blocking, event-driven applications in Rust. It's essential for async/await.

## Importance

This project is vital for developers learning asynchronous programming in Rust. It demonstrates how to make asynchronous HTTP requests, handle errors, and work with the async/await syntax in Rust.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone this repository using Git:
